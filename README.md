## Why did you choose to test the code that you did?
The following explains my decisions around placements of at least 5 different test cases:
<ul>
  <li><em>Test Case "____"</em> - </li>
  <li><em>Test Case "____"</em> - </li>
  <li><em>Test Case "____"</em> - </li>
  <li><em>Test Case "____"</em> - </li>
  <li><em>Test Case "____"</em> - </li>
</ul>
